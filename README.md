# MarkUp
This project is made as an attendance system to facilitate quick digital attendance of students. This allows teachers or professors to 
accurately see and verify the students and upload attendance.

## Motivation
My college had an obsolete method of taking up attendance in the form of roll calls or passing of sheets to mark the attendance.These 
sheets would usually get lost or there would be error while inputting or calculationg them. Moreover time wastage was huge as attendance 
percentage had to be calculated. The students also could not know these percentages in real time.
